 <b>Experience:</b>
 
       <b>1. Personal data in secured and hardened Nextcloud-Server
       
       The gateway host now uses the nginx reverse proxy capabilities to redirect requests to another 
       vhost based on the destination (directory). There is then again a virtual host per web application. 
       These always use the same server name (the local IP) but different ports. Since the vHosts only work 
       server-internally "behind" the gateway host and only the gateway host is the direct interface to 
       the Internet / the clients, the selection of the ports is irrelevant here. 
       As a result, no further ports need to be opened in the firewall, as all web applications seem to 
       use the standard ports 80 and 443. Which web application should ultimately be addressed is determined 
       only by the subdirectory of the web root (and not by the combination domain / port).

               * Outline Manager: an Electron application that can create Outline Servers on the cloud and talks to their access key 
	         management API to manage who has access to the server.
	       * Metrics Server: a REST service that the Outline Server talks to if the user opts-in to anonymous metrics sharing.

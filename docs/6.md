## Next steps

Get your computer or device to use the VPN. Please refer to:

**[Configure IPsec/L2TP VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md)**

**[Configure IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md)**

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#troubleshooting).

Enjoy your very own VPN!

## Important notes

For **Windows users**, this [one-time registry change](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#windows-error-809) is required if the VPN server and/or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router).

The same VPN account can be used by your multiple devices. However, due to an IPsec/L2TP limitation, if you wish to connect multiple devices simultaneously from behind the same NAT (e.g. home router), you must use only [IPsec/XAuth mode](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md).

For servers with an external firewall (e.g. [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)/[GCE](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)), open UDP ports 500 and 4500 for the VPN. Aliyun users, see [#433](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/issues/433).

If you need to edit VPN config files, you must first [start a Bash session](#bash-shell-inside-container) in the running container.

If you wish to add, edit or remove VPN user accounts, first update your `env` file, then you must remove and re-create the Docker container using instructions from the [next section](#update-docker-image). Advanced users can [bind mount](#bind-mount-the-env-file) the `env` file.

Clients are set to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN is active. If another DNS provider is preferred, [read below](#use-alternative-dns-servers).

### Check server status

To check the status of your IPsec VPN server, you can pass `ipsec status` to your container like this:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec status
```

Or display current established VPN connections:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec whack --trafficstatus
```

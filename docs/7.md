## Update Docker image

To update your Docker image and container, follow these steps:

```
docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

If the Docker image is already up to date, you should see:

```
Status: Image is up to date for hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:latest
```

Otherwise, it will download the latest version. To update your Docker container, first write down all your VPN login details (refer to "Retrieve VPN login details" above). Then remove the Docker container with `docker rm -f ipsec-vpn-server`. Finally, re-create it using instructions from the "How to use this image" section.

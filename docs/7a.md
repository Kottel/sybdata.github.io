### Windows Error 809

> The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server is not responding.

To fix this error, a <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/MX-Z/Client_VPN/Troubleshooting_Client_VPN#Windows_Error_809" target="_blank">one-time registry change</a> is required because the VPN server and/or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router). Download and import the `.reg` file below, or run the following from an <a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/open-elevated-command-prompt-windows/" target="_blank">elevated command prompt</a>. **You must reboot your PC when finished.**

- For Windows Vista, 7, 8.x and 10 ([download .reg file](https://static.ls20.com/reg-files/v1/Fix_VPN_Error_809_Windows_Vista_7_8_10_Reboot_Required.reg))

  ```console
  REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent /v AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule /t REG_DWORD /d 0x2 /f
  ```

- For Windows XP ONLY ([download .reg file](https://static.ls20.com/reg-files/v1/Fix_VPN_Error_809_Windows_XP_ONLY_Reboot_Required.reg))

  ```console
  REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IPSec /v AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule /t REG_DWORD /d 0x2 /f
  ```

Although uncommon, some Windows systems disable IPsec encryption, causing the connection to fail. To re-enable it, run the following command and reboot your PC.

- For Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.x and 10 ([download .reg file](https://static.ls20.com/reg-files/v1/Fix_VPN_Error_809_Allow_IPsec_Reboot_Required.reg))

  ```console
  REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters /v ProhibitIpSec /t REG_DWORD /d 0x0 /f
  ```

### Windows Error 628

> The connection was terminated by the remote computer before it could be completed.

To fix this error, please follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the wireless/network icon in system tray, select **Open Network and Sharing Center**.
1. On the left, click **Change adapter settings**. Right-click on the new VPN and choose **Properties**.
1. Click the **Security** tab. Select "Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec (L2TP/IPSec)" for **Type of VPN**.
1. Click **Allow these protocols**. Make sure the "Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)" checkbox is checked.
1. Click the **Advanced settings** button.
1. Select **Use preshared key for authentication** and enter `Your VPN IPsec PSK` for the **Key**.
1. Click **OK** to close the **Advanced settings**.
1. Click **OK** to save the VPN connection details.

### Windows 10 upgrades

After upgrading Windows 10 version (e.g. from 1709 to 1803), you may need to re-apply the fix above for [Windows Error 809](#windows-error-809) and reboot.

### Windows 8/10 DNS leaks

Windows 8.x and 10 use "smart multi-homed name resolution" by default, which may cause "DNS leaks" when using the native IPsec VPN client if your DNS servers on the Internet adapter are from the local network segment. To fix, you may either <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/guide-prevent-dns-leakage-while-using-a-vpn-on-windows-10-and-windows-8/" target="_blank">disable smart multi-homed name resolution</a>, or configure your Internet adapter to use DNS servers outside your local network (e.g. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). When finished, <a href="https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227988627-How-to-clear-the-DNS-Cache-" target="_blank">clear the DNS cache</a> and reboot your PC.

In addition, if your computer has IPv6 enabled, all IPv6 traffic (including DNS queries) will bypass the VPN. Learn how to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929852/guidance-for-configuring-ipv6-in-windows-for-advanced-users" target="_blank">disable IPv6</a> in Windows.

### macOS VPN traffic

OS X (macOS) users: If you can successfully connect using IPsec/L2TP mode, but your public IP does not show `Your VPN Server IP`, read the [OS X](#os-x) section above and complete this step: Click the **Advanced** button and make sure the **Send all traffic over VPN connection** checkbox is checked. Then re-connect the VPN.

### iOS/Android sleep mode

To save battery, iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) will automatically disconnect Wi-Fi shortly after the screen turns off (sleep mode). As a result, the IPsec VPN disconnects. This behavior is <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2333948" target="_blank">by design</a> and cannot be configured. If you need the VPN to auto-reconnect when the device wakes up, try <a href="https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install" target="_blank">OpenVPN</a> instead, which <a href="https://docs.openvpn.net/connecting/connecting-to-access-server-with-apple-ios/faq-regarding-openvpn-connect-ios/" target="_blank">has support for options</a> such as "Reconnect on Wakeup" and "Seamless Tunnel".

Android devices will also disconnect Wi-Fi shortly after entering sleep mode, unless the option "Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep" is enabled. This option is no longer available in Android 8 (Oreo). Alternatively, you may try enabling the "Always-on VPN" option to stay connected. Learn more <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9089766?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Android 6 and above

If you are unable to connect using Android 6 or above:

1. Tap the "Settings" icon next to your VPN profile. Select "Show advanced options" and scroll down to the bottom. If the option "Backward compatible mode" exists (see image below), enable it and reconnect the VPN. If not, try the next step.
1. Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` on the VPN server. Find `sha2-truncbug=yes` and replace it with `sha2-truncbug=no`. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart` (<a href="https://libreswan.org/wiki/FAQ#Configuration_Matters" target="_blank">Ref</a>).

### Chromebook issues

Chromebook users: If you are unable to connect, try these steps: Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` on the VPN server. Find the line `phase2alg=...` and append `,aes_gcm-null` at the end. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart`.

### Other errors

If you encounter other errors, refer to the links below:

* https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rrasblog/2009/08/12/troubleshooting-common-vpn-related-errors/   

### Additional steps

Please try these additional troubleshooting steps:

First, restart services on the VPN server:

```bash
service ipsec restart
service xl2tpd restart
```

If using Docker, run `docker restart ipsec-vpn-server`.

Then reboot your VPN client device, and retry the connection. If still unable to connect, try removing and recreating the VPN connection, by following the instructions in this document. Make sure that the VPN credentials are entered correctly.

Check the Libreswan (IPsec) and xl2tpd logs for errors:

```bash
# Ubuntu & Debian
grep pluto /var/log/auth.log
grep xl2tpd /var/log/syslog

# CentOS & RHEL
grep pluto /var/log/secure
grep xl2tpd /var/log/messages
```

Check status of the IPsec VPN server:

```bash
ipsec status
ipsec verify
```

Show current established VPN connections:

```bash
ipsec whack --trafficstatus
```

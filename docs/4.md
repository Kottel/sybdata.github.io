### Retrieve VPN login details

If you did not specify an `env` file in the `docker run` command above, `VPN_USER` will default to `vpnuser` and both `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` and `VPN_PASSWORD` will be randomly generated. To retrieve them, view the container logs:

```
docker logs ipsec-vpn-server
```

Search for these lines in the output:

```
Connect to your new VPN with these details:

Server IP: your_vpn_server_ip
IPsec PSK: your_ipsec_pre_shared_key
Username: your_vpn_username
Password: your_vpn_password
```

(Optional) Backup the generated VPN login details (if any) to the current directory:

```
docker cp ipsec-vpn-server:/opt/src/vpn-gen.env ./
```
